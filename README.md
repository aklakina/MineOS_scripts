# crafty (it is in the crafty branch)
Crafty is another project i am currently working on with the main team. It is similar to MineOS i just made an installer for it with a GUI based on internet explorer. The .exe has a few security issues so if you would not want to risk it then run the .ps1. It does the same you just need 1 more click to run it.
Crafty wiki is linked in the installer.
